There are 100 data sets included in this collection, named 
patientstatus[0-99].ds.  Each line in a data set represents a health care
record where a person in the simulation city did one of three things:
visit an ED department, purchase medication, or was absent from school/work.
The fields in the data set can take on the following values:

1. XY: The region the case comes from (NW, N, NE, W, C, E, SW, S, SE)
2. age: child, working or senior
3. gender: male or female
4. flu: none, low, high or decline
5. day_of_week: sat, sun or weekday
6. weather: hot or cold
7. season: winter, spring, summer or fall
8. action: purchase, evisit or absent
9. reported_symptom: none, respiratory, nausea or rash
10. drug: none, nyquil, aspirin or vomit-b-gone
11. date: Jan-01-2002 to Dec-31-2003
12. daynum: The date represented as an integer index

The file release_daycode.txt contains information about the anthrax attack.
The first column contains the index of the patientstatus*.ds file and the
second column contains the daynum of the anthrax attack.  For example,
if a row in release_daycode.txt contains 21 74282, then patientstatus21.ds
has an anthrax attack on daynum 74282.
